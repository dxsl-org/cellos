# Cellos Project Roadmap

**Project**: Cellos (Jarvis Hybrid OS)
**Current version**: 0.2.1-dev (Mycelium Era)
**Current phase**: Phase 1 - Core Stability; active product stage G1 Robot & Embedded
**Last updated**: 2026-08-19

This file is now the roadmap entrypoint. The previous all-in-one roadmap is
preserved as a read-only content snapshot at
[project-roadmap-legacy.md](project-roadmap-legacy.md). Use it
only when a historical decision is not represented by the current topic pages.

> **2026-08-20 G1 common-driver update:** Phase 03 is complete for the BCM/RPi3 lane. Real hardware passed GPIO17-to-GPIO27 edge detection, BCM BSC1 explicit data NACK, GPIO actuator readback, and BCM SPI0 `AA55` loopback; AArch64 QEMU separately passed PL061, PL011, and bounded pinned-worker regression gates. DesignWare I2C/SPI remains conditional on verified board compatible, MMIO, IRQ, and pinmux evidence.

## Current Direction

Cellos is being shaped around product stages, not only phase numbers:

- G1 Robot & Embedded: RV64/ARM64 SBC-class robot/embedded system with bounded
  memory, hardware I/O, fast boot, and never-die supervision.
- G2 Server & Specialized PC: x86_64/server qualification, SMP throughput,
  large storage, zero-downtime service upgrades, desktop/tooling depth.
- G3 NPU-native Compute OS: parked until real NPU hardware and vendor API
  experience inform the contract.
- G4 Full Rust std for Tier 1 Cells: planned as a `rust-std` runtime profile
  using pure-Rust PAL/rustc target work, not `std` over mlibc.
- G5 Virtualization Platform: research/design overlay after G4.

## Current Codebase Facts

- Cargo workspace members: 111, verified with `cargo metadata --no-deps`.
- HAL shape: `hal/core`, four `hal/soc/*` crates, fifteen `hal/traits/*`
  crates, and three `hal/arch/*` crates.
- HAL to kernel Rust ABI hook signatures are single-sourced in
  `hal/traits/arch/src/kernel_abi.rs`; `scripts/check-hal-boundaries.sh`
  rejects new local `extern "Rust"` declarations under `hal/arch`.
- Board descriptors live in root `boards/`; seven descriptors are active
  integration targets, while `q35-x86_32`, `virt-riscv32`, and `virt-aarch32`
  remain placeholder-only documentation entries.
- Active native scripting runtime: Lua. MicroPython is historical roadmap text
  and is not a current Cargo workspace member.
- Application execution uses Tier 1/2/3 terminology. `Tier 1b` and `Tier 3b`
  are legacy guide aliases for Tier 1 runtime profiles and Tier 3 Linux guests;
  SDK packaging uses named modules, not numbered tiers.

## Immediate Open Gates

- Production signing is not fleet-enforced by default: `signing-required` is
  non-default and the non-dev public key path is still a `[0u8; 32]` placeholder.
- Physical hardware evidence must remain separate from QEMU/compile evidence.
  RPi3 smoke has been merged, but VF2/Pioneer/RPi4 physical lanes are still
  hardware-gated unless logs say otherwise.
- AArch64 test-hooks runtime evidence remains host-gated where the existing
  `qemu_exit::AArch64Semihosting` issue blocks the lane.
- Net-broker has implemented pieces for Noise/identity/routing, but `main.rs`
  still marks K1 loading, beacon sockets, relay dispatch, leases, and enrollment
  as TODO wiring.

## Update Rule

Keep this file short. Put maintained detail in the matching
`docs/roadmap/*.md` topic file. Do not edit the legacy snapshot; historical
delivery evidence belongs in `project-changelog.md`.
